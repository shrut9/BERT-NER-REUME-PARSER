# INTRODUCTION
This project develops a BERT-based NER model to extract key information from resumes for efficient filtration.
The model will extract important features from resume 
BERT’s advanced language understanding enhances the accuracy of extracting relevant information.
Named Entity Recognition will classify crucial details, such as skills, education, and experience.
A user-friendly GUI will allow recruiters to upload resumes easily and view filtered results.

# OBJECTIVES
Develop and fine-tune the bert-based NER model to effectively handle and extract information from resumes with varying formats and styles, ensuring consistent and accurate extraction across diverse resume types.
Implement advanced techniques to refine the model's ability to interpret and match resume details against specific and nuanced job eligibility criteria, enhancing the alignment between candidate qualifications and job requirements.
Develop a user-friendly GUI that displays the output of the NER model for the recruitment process, focusing on improving usability and efficiency for recruiters in uploading resumes and accessing filtered results.

# WHY BERT+NER?
Contextual Understanding:
Traditional resume parsers relied on keyword matching or manually crafted rules, which often failed with ambiguous terms or varying formats.
BERT allows the model to “understand” the meaning of words within the broader context of the resume, improving entity recognition across diverse language usage.
Example: In one resume, "Java" might appear alongside “backend development” (implying a programming language), while in another it could appear in a section related to “international experience” (implying the island). BERT can distinguish these contexts.
Flexibility Across Formats:
Resumes come in various formats: some are neatly structured, while others are creative with non-standard layouts, different fonts, or complex formatting.
The BERT + NER system is adaptable to these variations. Since BERT handles raw text directly, it doesn’t require specific formatting rules.
Unlike rule-based systems, this method doesn’t need extensive manual rule crafting, which can break down when encountering non-standard formats.
